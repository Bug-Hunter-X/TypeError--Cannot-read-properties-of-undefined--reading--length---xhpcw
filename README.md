# Uncommon JavaScript Bug: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle JavaScript error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`.

The bug arises when attempting to access the `length` property of a variable that might be `undefined`. This often happens when dealing with data received from external sources or user input, where the expected data structure might not always be present.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code attempts to obtain the length of a variable `x`.  If `x` is `null`, the code attempts to handle it, however, it does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is `undefined`, which leads to a `TypeError`.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a check for `undefined` before accessing the `length` property.  This ensures that the code gracefully handles cases where `x` might not be an object with a `length` property.
